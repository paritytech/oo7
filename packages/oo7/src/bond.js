/**
 * An object which tracks a single, potentially variable, value.
 * {@link Bond}s may be updated to new values with {@link Bond#changed} and reset to an indeterminate
 * ("not ready") value with {@link Bond#reset}.
 *
 * {@link Bond}s track their dependents - aspects of the program, including other {@link Bond}s,
 * which reference their current value. Dependents may be added with {@link Bond#use} and
 * removed with {@link Bond#drop}.
 *
 * A {@link Bond} may be tied to a particular function to ensure it is called whenever
 * the value changes. This implies a dependency, and can be registered with {@link Bond#tie} and
 * dropped with {@link Bond#untie}. A function may also be called should the {@link Bond} be reverted
 * to an undefined value; in this case {@link Bond#notify} and {@link Bond#unnotify} should
 * be used.
 *
 * {@link Bond}s can be made to execute a function once their value becomes ready
 * using {@link Bond#then}, which in some sense replicates the same function in the
 * context of a `Promise`. The similar function {@link Bond#done} is also supplied which
 * executes a given function when the {@link Bond} reaches a value which is considered
 * "final", determined by {@link Bond#isDone} being implemented and `true`. Precisely
 * what any given {@link Bond} considers final depends entirely on the subclass of
 * {@link Bond}; for the {@link Bond} class itself, `isDone` always returns `false` and thus
 * {@link Bond#done} is unusable. The value of the {@link Bond}, once _ready_, may
 * be logged to the console with the {@link Bond#log} function.
 *
 * A {@link Bond} can provide a derivative {@link Bond} whose value reflects the "readiness"
 * of the original, using {@link Bond#ready} and conversely {@link Bond#notReady}. This
 * can also be queried normally with {@link Bond#isReady}.
 *
 * One or a number of {@link Bond}s can be converted into a single {Promise} with the
 * {@link Bond#promise} function.
 *
 * `Bonds` can be composed. {@link Bond#map} creates a new {@link Bond} whose value is a
 * transformation. {@link Bond.all} creates a new {@link Bond} which evaluates to the array
 * of values of each of a number of dependent {@link Bond}s. {@link Bond.mapAll} combines
 * both. {@link Bond#reduce} allows a {@link Bond} that evaluates to array to be
 * transformed into some other value recursively.
 *
 * {@link Bond#sub} forms a derivative {@link Bond} as the subscript (square-bracket
 * indexing). {@link Bond#subscriptable} may be used to return a `Proxy` object that
 * allows the {@link Bond} to be subscripted (square-bracket indexed) directly without
 * need of the {@link Bond#sub} function.
 *
 * {@link Bond} is built to be subclassed. When subclassing, three functions are
 * useful to implement. {@link Bond#isDone} may be implemented
 * in order to make {@link Bond#done} be useful. {@link Bond#initialise} is called exactly once
 * when there becomes at least one dependent; {@link Bond#finalise} is called when there
 * are no longer any dependents.
 *
 * _WARNING_: You should not attempt to use the `toString` function with this
 * class. It cannot be meaningfully converted into a string, and to attempt it
 * will give an undefined result.
